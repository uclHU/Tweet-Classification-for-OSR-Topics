I m pleased to hear you support women only spaces. I m confused as to why you re finding these statistics tiresome amp accusing them of enforcing gender stereotypes when it helps the cause you support We need to stick together not call each other names like soul sapping shrews .,6
"Not often I disagree with you Liz but their really isn t an ""as usual"" when it comes to yearly deaths. It fluctuates quite a lot to be fair.",6
Not read this yet but found it just now,1
I m interested in the data on this as it seems counterintuitive that fossil has less climate impact than grown crops. I understand that a lot of this is down to land use change. Anyone got an idiots guide on land use impacts The Transport Environment link isn t that helpful.,7
So you need KYC for bitcoin You KYC they know exactly what you re purchasing they are just farming your data for real. Incredible.,7
I failed twice. I ve lied on every CV/application since including University and have never been questioned. Held jobs in admin payroll data management. Am I gonna have to go back to year 10 again before I take another job,0

Scanning tickets this way works really well for us One of our volunteers will run around to scan them before the kids leave the chapel hall where we have hot food for them It means we tick security measures and it doesn t effect the kids at all,7
1. Data from the Census amp the MoJ tells us transwomen are 415x more likely than women to be in prison for sex offences. This is about the FACTS amp women s safety. 2. Women s spaces also afford privacy dignity amp psychological safety which is also why they need to be female only.,6
Yeah you have no idea how stats work or what is considered representative data. There are only 125 convicted female sex offenders out of 30.1 million women which is 1 in 243 000. This is a tiny % but is still a representative stat cos it s based on actual population data.,6
I d also like to see more data at the low end. It looks from that graph that lt 30k after housing no cars,4

kristy Agreed Wouldn t it be interesting to see a breakdown of that. I ve always thought the government should look at staff churn or at least publish the data alongside other school data...,0
just studying maths until 18 is too simplistic. But we absolutely need to be educating people in the maths skills to handle data/coding/analytics amp so on. Everything is underpinned by computer science and maths in modern society. Urgh not to defend the PM Yuck,0
Nope. Maybe in the past but we live in different times post pandemic and anxiety over emergency care is increasing broadly according to all data sources. The govt will get the blame it s interlinked with other issues wages cost of living inflation migration etc .,3

No you provided statistics for nurses. Most public sector workers are severely underpaid. When you take into account inflation most have actually had a pay cut,5
sn1 The stats don t consider the state of the defence in front of him He isn t amazing by all means. But you d get no better on our budget in a January window imo.,2
They should record the crime as trans male which shows in brackets what they were born as. That way the statistics will be accurate and we can see if there are more trans male sex offenders than in males or females like some studies suggest.,2

It s heartbreaking but who voted for the tories with 80 seats in Parliament that a lot votes statistics shows tories rely on older voters most and it doesn t make sense the tories underfund the NHS and social care it s suicide.,1

This: UK immigration stats show visa surge from india pakistan 4 Indians have just started at the care home my missus is at. They applied for jobs a day before they came to the UK. Cheap labour with no clue of EU workers rights. There will be no pay rises. Its deliberate.,6
I don t think he s thought that hard. He s put this out to make people discuss this as ironically I did with my stats class this week and detract from the mess the country is in. I don t think the country lacks in Maths skills the narrative of I can t do maths is the problem,0
Covid stats EU population 447 million EU covid deaths 2.22 million Africa population 1.22 billion Africa covid deaths 257 984 thousand Should we discuss the vaccine take up EU 95% first dose / 68% second dose Africa 30% first dose / 6% second dose Effective,6
"FUCK OFF BACK women lie about rape and the government has their back. When the ""crime survey"" asks how many men were falsely accused then come back amp chat it is a 1 sided rape propaganda hit piece to artificially inflate rape ""statistics"". I work with statistics every day BTW",2
I ve been told by my LA that it will trigger a safety meeting internally if enough are reported. We need this data to prove areas are unsafe rather than just crime reports sadly,2
NHS/Rail Strike/fuel poverty should be priorities maybe,7
.... I just wish people had thought more for themselves about the risks. There wasn t any safety data and no one was able to give fully informed consent. All for a virus that is low risk to the majority of the population.,6
4/end My conclusion from this is that I will not drive in lane one on smart motorways if at all possible even if it is clear. The stats on deaths per mile for these roads are significantly worse than normal motorways should mean they get scrapped.,6
I think you ll find it s the climate mental patients who pick certain weather events as climate collapse proof and tony presents historical data and news clips on them particular weather events to prove it s nothing unusual,7
Here s some up to date data from Germany,6
Wasn t it in response to negative economic forecasts about Brexit though Which been have proved to have been fairly accurate It wasn t a general lament it was a dismissal of data because it didn t fit the narrative. So in fact the shorthand version is pretty much spot on.,3

That doesn t explain the 40% increase in all cause mortality in group life subscribers in the US coinciding with work related mandates. This normally healthy group death normally 30 40% that of the whole population suddenly became the most ill. The data are strong.,6

Data shows there s no climate catastrophe looming climatologist Dr J Christy debunks the narrative,7
Not my words But using this study to infer risk is disingenuous. Even if we accept those 3 were killed by the vaccine how would you calculate risk to the general population from this data You d need to know exactly how representative those 25 or 35 are. And we don t,6
I m a big advocate of improving or more precisely reducing dislike of maths. But that should mean more applicable/life skills maths incl stats throughout all subjects not this approach. This from Sunak is just fluffy nonsense at this time of crises.,0
I understand ONS are working on another update to the data. What would I expect to see 1. Unvaccinated will have significantly higher all cause age standardised death rates. 2. Unvaccinated will have slightly higher age standardised deaths rates from covid. Reasoning follows.,6
Surely it is over for most of us. No,5
oxford It would be helpful to see stats include comparisons between never vaccinated to vaccinated. unvaccinated often includes many who have actually had a vaccine so skews many reports. Professor Norman Fenton noticed a big increase in deaths just after vaccination.,6

There is apparently nothing we can do to get back his data. My last chance is to write to headquarters but we are now tired of hearing the same answer. We know where he has spent the money and he must be on cameras. But the police don t have the resources of course.,2

Do you have data on household energy consumption to compare today s energy efficient water heating/heating compared to that of the 70s or is your tweet simply a rose tinted anecdote,7

Chatting with a Brexit supporting colleague on economy figures and he cited that C19 and Ukraine are key factors that must be included and not to blame brexit as it hasn t had a chance to work. Is there any data that takes this into account against our competitors,3
Why teach us math until 18 but not teach basic like skills in school like taxes how to qualify and apply for a mortgage. The importance of insurances ect. Not quadratic equations and statistics til we re all bored into an early grave.,0
Oh yeh I don t think they were suggesting they won t. Assigned is a useful term though particularly in the case of intersex people. But your opposition is noted. Important I think for everyone to be able to state what terms they are comfortable with being addressed as.,6
Pretty sure I do. The fact that you re specifically selecting data that excludes all Covid deaths shows you don t as they too contribute to figures for excess mortality.,6
46 % where is your stats for proof . Because unemployment is at an all time low . So who isn t paying tax,6

CoViD Committee does not provide data. Rather we ask for data interview experts government ministers ordinary people with relevant experience etc. You or the Committee can ask for data. FOI gives everyone access to most data. But Committee will try to take balanced view.,1
The law literally criminalises parents who smack their kids. That s what it s there for. Last I read that particular offence wasn t being recorded by Police Scotland 2021 . There was no charge code for them to do so and so data about the impact of the new office was absent,5
Oh right. Is any of it allowed in the U.K. If so Mail me some lol I don t trust British boarder security to not let you give me my food again,7
There isn t and it possibly doesn t. That s why it irks me that many companies and activists refer to LGB people as Queer . It s not been agreed by anyone and could never be. Activists hate the G and L words because it conjures images of white men and feminist women.,6
ie Here s some data on citizens living abroad from the world economic forum. As you can see given our population we a have by far the most amount of citizens living abroad it s not even close No doubt you ll come up with some guff to attempt to discredit.,6
She just picked her kid up from school where a 6 year old shot a teacher so maybe she wasn t quite in the right frame of mind to reel off exact statistics to satisfy the NRA apologists.,0
"Real science not half truths: 1 2 Only 2 small areas increasing. 4 are decreasing and the Russian population is ""unknown"" 3 Misleading. There s a gap between production amp demand that s increasing amp yields are predicted /cont",6
Eh that particular data would be interesting but not necessarily reliable. People consistently rate crime as higher now than in the past but relatively reliable statistics suggest otherwise.,2
The sudden deaths are caused by the vaccine you think Not by covid itself So part of the virus is worse than the whole virus Really Interpreting data without contextual understanding can tell the wrong story. There are far easier ways to kill us off than an optional vaccine.,6

No again sorry if you didn t read it properly... I am saying Owen Jones was wrong for declaring the innocence of a sex offender and mocking the victims. Can you not understand basic English And stats show trans women are more likely to murder than be killed. Hardly vulnerable,6
I don t know the stats but suspect first more accurate ratio but I don t think it s anywhere close to 100 per year. Not deaths.,6
Thank you. Gulana Kulalu is a game changer in ensuring food security in Kenya.,7
I couldn t careless what you call me. It s the way you deny males are a risk to females amp believe that somehow a gender identity changes that fact despite the data proving you wrong. You believe males can do what they want amp females need to shut up amp accept it. That is right wing,6

Yates Maths The age to which maths is taught is irrelevant. Everyone needs to know the maths they need to participate in society effectively. That s changing as the focus on statistics during the pandemic showed. The key is for school leavers to accept lifelong learning as the norm.,0

It s difficult talking about crimes against humanity IMO at any government level. Better for him to have used his privilege to demand evidence and stats on the excess deaths. He gave them the opportunity to suspend him with the statement. Maybe that s what he intended,6

I totally agree about hidden stuff especially the heart problems and sudden deaths my main concern Only a fool would ignore that. There have been accusations that one of our Heart charities covered up data but they ve denied it. They re actually doing a study of it now.,6
He is suggesting that this shit only happens in single mother homes and if you look at the statistics he s got a point. Children from single mother homes face every single statistical disadvantage.,0
Statistically you are wrong even government BS stats tell you this. You are trying to make out you watched countless children die from COVID when you are really seeing countless children dying from vaccine injury. Open your eyes The truth is out there,1
Are they the style of stats that said people died with covid and within 28 days of positive test. If so then we can rightly now say 1000 excess non Covid deaths are those dying with vaccine now . That way we can bump up the numbers like they did during the scamdemic,6

"Define the ""eminent scientists"" who back his statements amp provide proper data for scrutiny to back your dangerous amp ill informed claims. I would suggest you read the ONS data. Grifting is not simply good enough",6

I suspect the perpetrators are not ordinary citizens but members of the security forces even soldiers in plain clothes. Their questioning is too concise. Furthermore this is happening in Guveya Chiwenga s rural home district. Food for thought.,7
Women Yep men born men funny that. However they identify amp actually I believe recent stats show men who id as trans are a higher offending rate of abuse than men who don t try to id out of their birth sex. Honest stats are so useful guess that s why GII tries to stop them,6

You do realise that if one can identify as a woman when they are born a male they can also identify as Aquarius when their birth date makes them a Capricorn.,6
me christian 313 Because that s a lie. When you look at the statistics the majority of the deaths were over 80. Of course every life matters but what s been done to children is unforgivable when there s no proof that restrictions made any difference to who was going to die or not.,6
me christian 313 I ve got the statistics you numpty. You also have imposters on your side of the grift so no I don t believe she is who she claims to be either.,5
rowling And by the way your stats for violent crime against trans people are from a US study and include South American sex workers where trans women are disp represented. No trans people are recorded as being killed since 2017 in U.K. Over 1000 women killed by men in that time.,6
Stats can be manipulated which is a huge problem. Often carbon sequestration in our wonderful farming countryside here is not taken into account when compared with other food businesses where are they absorbing/storing their carbon They re not But fail to mention that,7

My data show that in 2015 Somali were 6.29% of Ethiopia s population the third largest after Oromo and Amhara. This is official data. Do you have different statistics about the regional population,6
No i m saying yours wouldn t change even if i did try that s very clear. I agree Ivermectin looks to work I also agree the vaccines are not very good however are they causing all the excess deaths You are probably certain it s a yes i will wait for more data.,6
Why is their so many excess deaths and a lot are cardiac related not just UK No one on the news is looking at the data it can be easily analysed,6
There is no pandemic of hate lol you wanna be the victim so badly. If there was doesn t make sense why black on white murder rates are so low. Also just because you hit a white person doesn t mean your racist or hate white people,2

I believe its blatantly obvious the hegemony ancestral bloodlines of world power have decided to reduce the world s population. Most people cannot comprehend the wickedness of their plans despite a mass of evidence and data cognitive dissonance is the problem,6
I think you ll find that s a very inaccurate statement. violence against women is culturally acceptable in certain religions and societies. Look at the data on the religion and nationalities of serious violent crime committed by men and compare with their percentage in the pop.,2
But if 80% our even 95% of the deaths are from people that did get the vaccine it s harder to see a correlation because 100% of the population also got COVID in this simplified example . Especially since this is rare. So I think we just don t have enough data yet to say.,6
Per the decision where personal data have been or will be disclosed to recipients the data controller must disclose to the data subject upon request the actual identity of those recipients. This is enables the data subject to exercise other rights conferred by the GDPR 3/9 .,6
However where it is not yet possible to identify the recipients of personal data the data controller is required to indicate only the categories of the recipients in question rather than specifying the actual identity of the recipients 5/9 .,6
In practical terms when personal data is collected the controller could draft a privacy consent form which discloses only the categories of recipients amp invoke the lack of knowledge of the recipients actual identity.,6

That s not to say climate change isn t bringing spring forward here it absolutely is. But plant growth generally including leaf bud burst and flowering of wild plants like blackthorn rather than garden plants gives us more reliable data.,7
They won t live long anyway. The GOP has no plan to support the overpopulation of children brought into an already overcrowded world. Once born they are on their own. Getting rid of federal help like social security Medicare and food stamps while they re at it.,7

Looks bad but how about some stats on the health outcomes and lifespans of the people that consume this kind of food,7
So according to this data the U.K. took 56k refugees so why do you call this a problem probably represents less than the excess deaths from the effects of CoVid.,6

My first thought was I expect Newham has a bigger population . But I don t have an image of Newham that I do have slightly about Brighton. I think he makes his case that the Census question was badly worded and that the results from it are useless as data.,6
That s because they either stop collecting the stats or can t determine surprise surprise which sex is doing the offending and which is likely to be the victim:,6
Suella was telling truth grooming statistics prove that 28% of groomers are Asian who are 8% of population Pakistanis are 2.7% of population half of that number will be women. they accounted for massive offences grooming for population size. This can t be ignored again,6
If you agree that the stats show a higher likelihood of trans women committing sex offences than ordinary men then surely the last thing anyone should want to do is extend an invitation to trans women to be afforded access to women only spaces. That s what it s mostly about.,6
Even if the data is correct I must admit I do wonder how many of these so called child abusers were actually 17 year olds convicted of having entirely consensual sex with their 15 year old girlfriends.,6
Again I agree. From the data of this specific study we cannot conclude it was the sexual orientation. That hypothesis which I believe stems from other data of heterosexual transsexuals having typical brains for their sex. We would need to run an analysis on the authors data,6
Yet the report says often accurate data is collected yet when it is Asian men account for 75% of the crimes. Stop being an apologist for a culture of child rape.,6

LM skated over this in his slippery eel way. Mark Rowley needs to go and break up statistics into different categories including ethnicity and birth etc. Hogan Howe tried to do that and LM stopped him. See if Rowley is allowed to do it and publish that data. Sparks may fly,6
I guess Billy women don t want their crime stats to be disproportionately skewed by men identifying as women. Men commit 96% of sex crime and being trans doesn t lower this chance,6
Less than what There is no correlation never mind causation between lockdowns and a lower death rate. If anything the data suggest that countries with harsher/longer lockdowns have higher mid long term excess deaths due to telling people to stay home/not bother doctors.,6
Ok now apply those population and crime statistics to urban areas. The population and the crime stats are a LOT more evenly spread so your misrepresentation and misreading of them only shows your desire to demonise black people. Just put your hood on already.,6
Honestly I think Andrew tells it like it is. We re so divided in this country that nobody can agree on anything. We ve been given bad data amp lots of theories keep proving true. The population has lost the 1 micron of trust in the Gov that existed. Make you re own decisions.,6
No they don t. That s demonstrably not true. See the recent home office stats about police attacking women. Stats on deaths in police custody.,6
OldHaymarket It s not a discussion if you don t provide any data yet ignore the real dangers it s nothing more than an unfounded opinion that s not helpful in anyway and panders to an ill informed population.,6
And by sex rather than gender given that they keep telling us that you apparently have no idea what gender someone is unless you ask so that data is false anyway.,6
Can you provide the statistics for this. I ve just tried to find this can you point me in the direction of your data because all I have found doesn t suggest this is the case even when look at the figures as proportion of population within UK. Thanks in advance.,6
flo The statistics taken from the census identify 0.1% of the UK population as trans women. That s not 1%. That s 0.1% Labour is clearly NOT good at maths.,6
British domestic flight passengers generally have income of around double the national average and 90% of all domestic flights are taken by just 2% of the population,6
We have strict gun laws and have very few deaths by being shot. We have criminals who have used guns which are usually on other criminals. General law abiding citizens are rarely shot. Just look at the stats. America has a big problem with their gun culture.,6

What you are right about is that it is males who are a risk to women. What the statistics don t show at all is that males who identify as trans are a lesser risk that other males. What is sensible is that the protections and safeguards women have is based on sex not gender.,6

Of course you shouldn t be able to have female on an official document when you are male. It s absurd. We need to know what sex you are for various reasons such as crime and health data. If that changes sex crimes will increase and will start suffering from menopause.,6
I m also going to take the time to point out that there are not 93 trans people men or women incarcerated in the uk. The statistics you are leaning on are derived from official ones bit make a lot of incorrect assumptions,6
